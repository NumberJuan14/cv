            <h3>Coding and Computer Science</h3>
            <p class = "code-description">I began coding when I was little due to an interest in video games and wanting to know how they worked, thus I signed up for a multitude of coding camps starting in 4th grade. I continued pursuiting computer science in high school for all 4 years and am now an experienced coder. My primary coding language is Java but I am also able to code in Python/Pygame, CSS, and HTML and also have experience in Javascript, Visual Basic, C#, and C++.</p>

            <h3>Dramatic Acting</h3>
            <p class = "act-description">Though I see Computer Science as my main acadamic pursuit and future, my main extracurricular activity is theatre, specifically acting, which i have been doing for 7 years now and intend to pursuit as a club activity in university. Though, I have experience in tech and crew, I mainly enjoy acting, especially in smaller arena stages where the audience is up close and can really feel as if they are part of the show.</p>
